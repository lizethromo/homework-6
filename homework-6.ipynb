    "In [lecture 12](https://github.com/Physics177-2019/lecture-12) we introduced the [Ising model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model). In [lecture 14](https://github.com/Physics177-2019/lecture-14) we talked about how to practically implement a [MCMC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo) algorithm, using the 2D Ising model as an example. In this homework we will complete this exercise and use MCMC to study the 2D Ising model.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, the Ising model describes a set of spins arranged on a lattice. In two dimensions, the configuration is described by a collection of spin variables $\\sigma_{i,j}\\in\\{-1,1\\}$, with $i,j = 1, 2, \\ldots, N$. Here the energy of a configuration is\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "E(\\underline{\\sigma}) = -\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\sum_{j=1}^{N} J \\left(\\sigma_{i,j}\\,\\sigma_{i+1,j} + \\sigma_{i,j}\\,\\sigma_{i,j+1}\\right)\\,.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The coupling $J$ tells us how strong the interaction is between two neighboring spins. Here we'll assume periodic boundary conditions, so that the $(N+1)$th spin index is equal to $1$ -- in other words, $\\sigma_{N+1,j}=\\sigma_{1,j}$ and $\\sigma_{i,N+1}=\\sigma_{i,1}$."
